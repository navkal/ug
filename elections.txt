How to create new table

  CREATE TABLE <new_table_name> AS SELECT <column_list> FROM <old_table_name>





How we calculate Voter Engagement Score:

(function calculate_voter_engagement_score() in residents.py)

  (1)

  As a preliminary step, generate the ElectionHistory table, which lists all elections in our records (2009-2020).  Score each election based on recency and turnout: The more recent the election, and the lower the turnout, the higher the score.

  (2)

  Calculate voter_engagement_score:

  For each resident:

  If no record of voting:
  voter_engagement_score = 0

  else:
  max_sum = sum of election scores for all elections in which voter could have participated, based on initial residency date (guessed from assessment records) or 18th birthday, whichever is later

  actual_sum = sum of scores for all elections in which voter participated

  voter_engagement_score = 100 * actual_sum / max_sum
